    In the dynamic and constantly evolving world of virtual environments, Zadaroo.com stands out as a crucial repository for the OpenSimulator platform. With a mission to support the creativity and expansion of virtual worlds, Zadaroo has become a cherished resource for those building and enhancing their digital realms. Recognizing the importance of these 3D assets and creations, we're taking proactive steps to ensure their longevity by uploading Zadaroo's entire collection to the Internet Archive.
</p>
<h4>The Essence of Zadaroo.com</h4>
<p>
    Zadaroo.com offers a wealth of free metaverse resources specifically tailored for OpenSimulatorâ€”a widely used open-source server platform for hosting virtual worlds. Here's a glimpse into what Zadaroo provides:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>XML Imports:</strong> Crucial data files that allow users to import various objects into their OpenSimulator environments.</li>
    <li><strong>Clothing &amp; Body:</strong> Customizable attire and avatar components that bring individuality and style to the virtual populace.</li>
    <li><strong>Animations &amp; Poses:</strong> Dynamic elements that breathe life into avatars, enriching the virtual experience with movement and expression.</li>
    <li><strong>Terrain Textures:</strong> The building blocks of virtual landscapes, offering a diverse palette to shape immersive worlds.</li>
    <li><strong>Sculpts:</strong> 3D models that serve as fundamental structures for complex objects within the virtual space.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Zadaroo's commitment to the OpenSimulator community has fostered a collaborative and innovative ecosystem where creators can freely share and utilize these assets.
</p>
<h4>Archival Endeavor: Zadaroo Collections on the Internet Archive</h4>
<p>
    By archiving Zadaroo's content, we are creating a digital safe haven on the Internet Archive, ensuring that these resources remain accessible and intact for future generations of virtual world enthusiasts and builders. The Internet Archive serves as a digital library, archiving websites and their content for posterity.

The archival process is merely a measure of prudence, a way to honor the work of the many contributors and to ensure that these assets can withstand the test of time.

<h3>Move To Static</h3>
<tt>By: Timothy Francis Rogers</tt>

<p>
    It has been a long time since this site has been updated, I felt it was finally time to convert the site to a static resource site to just download the content. Bandwidth reports still show that stuff is quite oftenly still accessed, however running this site on WordPress is not really a good option any longer. The reason to move to a static site, is to stop the maintance of the constant spam and previous attacks on the WordPress installation. Since the site doesn't have any changing content, this made the most sense.
</p>
<p>
    Keeping in true spirit with making everything opensource and under the Public Domain License, the entire source code of the site is now available on GitHub for anyone to download or even make and push changes they think might help improve the site. In the coming months, I will be providing a full archive of all the assests of the site as well for anyone to have a full clone of the site and its assets as well. For the mean time, this site's hosting and assets hosting behind a CDN will be paid for by myself Timothy Francis Rogers till I either die or becomes financially impossible for me to. Since moving to static site, and <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html" target="_blank">Backblaze B2</a> and <a href="https://cloudflare.com" target="_blank">CloudFlare</a> this site costs litteral pennies a month to host. The rough cost estimate is around $0.85/month which is very managable.
