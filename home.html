<h3>Move To Static</h3>
<tt>By: Timothy Francis Rogers</tt>

    It has been a long time since this site has been updated, I felt it was finally time to convert the site to a static resource site to just download the content. Bandwidth reports still show that stuff is quite oftenly still accessed, however running this site on WordPress is not really a good option any longer. The reason to move to a static site, is to stop the maintance of the constant spam and previous attacks on the WordPress installation. Since the site doesn't have any changing content, this made the most since.

    Keeping in true spirit with making everything opensource and under the Public Domain License, the entire source code of the site is now available on GitHub for anyone to download or even make and push changes they think might help improve the site. In the coming months, I will be providing a full archive of all the assests of the site as well for anyone to have a full clone of the site and its assets as well. For the mean time, this site's hosting and assets hosting behind a CDN will be paid for by myself Timothy Francis Rogers till I either die or becomes financially impossible for me to. Since moving to static site, and <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html" target="_blank">Backblaze B2</a> and <a href="https://cloudflare.com" target="_blank">CloudFlare</a> this site costs litteral pennies a month to host. The rough cost estimate is around $0.85/month which is very managable.
